            <h1>PRE-COLONIZATION PERIOD</h1>
    
            <p class="mb-5">
              The Philippine archipelago was formed some 50 million years ago
              through volcanic eruptions. It saw its first inhabitants around 30,000
              years ago, and by the tenth century A.D, the land was occupied by
              Chinese settlers and Muslim traders from Borneo. Islam was dominant at
              the time, and the basic structure of society was a three-tier
              civilization. There is little information about this era, except the
              Laguna Copperplate Inscription- the Philippines' oldest known written
              records.
            </p>
            <h1>SPANISH COLONIZATION</h1>
            <p class="mb-5">
              In 1521, the islands were claimed in Spain by Ferdinand Magellan, a
              Portuguese explorer. This is how the name of the nation (Las Felipinas
              at the time) was originated as it was named after King Philip II of
              Spain. They ruled the Philippines for over three centuries, after
              which the natives started their journey of independence. There were
              three initial faces of the movement- Marcelo H. de Pilar, Jose Rizal,
              and Mariano Ponce. The movement gained momentum after Jose Rizal was
              executed on charges of rebellion. This led to the formation of a
              secret society by the name of Katipunan, steered by Emilio Aguinaldo.
              The Philippine Revolution was started in 1896, and after negotiations,
              the Pact of Biak-na-Bato was formed in 1897. This pact prompted the
              exile of the rebels to Hong Kong. The flag of the Philippines, as
              known today, was designed by Aguinaldo and his rebel companions during
              this time.
            </p>
            <h1>AMERICAN COLONIZATION</h1>
            <p class="mb-5">
              Alongside the Philippine quest for independence, the Spanish-American
              war was at large in 1898 for Cuba's liberation. A Treaty settled the
              war in December 1898, where Spain ceded their rule of the Philippines
              (along with Guam and Puerto Rico) to America. After a series of
              negotiations and confusions, then-US President William McKinley
              appointed the First Philippine Republic in January 1899. However, the
              US's subsequent actions were not received well by the Filipinos, and
              the Philippine-American war broke out in February 1899. The war lasted
              for two years and ended in defeat for the Filipinos. The American rule
              was established on the archipelago, and all the rebellions were
              squashed for the next thirty years. In 1935, the Commonwealth of the
              Philippines was established by the US government with distinct plans
              for independence. However, the Second World War broke in 1941, and the
              Japanese military invaded the Philippines, rendering the US (in the
              Philippines) feckless for two to three years. During this time, the
              Filipinos rebelled against Japanese rule through underground guerilla
              activity. The US returned in October of 1944 and defeated the Japanese
              with the help of Filipino troops.
