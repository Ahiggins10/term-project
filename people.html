                      Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy March 22, 1869 - February 6, 1964)
                      was a Filipino revolutionary, statesman, and military
                      leader who is the youngest president of the Philippines
                      (1899-1901) and is recognized as the first president of
                      the Philippines and of an Asian constitutional republic.
                      He led Philippine forces first against Spain in the
                      Philippine Revolution (1896-1898), then in the
                      Spanish-American War (1898), and finally against the
                      United States during the Philippine-American War
                      (1899-1901).

                      Aguinaldo remains a controversial figure in Filipino
                      history. Though he has been recommended as a national hero
                      of the Philippines, many have criticized him for the
                      deaths of the revolutionary leader Andrés Bonifacio and
                      general Antonio Luna, as well as his collaboration with
                      the Japanese Empire during their occupation of the
                      Philippines in World War II.
