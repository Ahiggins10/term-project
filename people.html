                      Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy March 22, 1869 - February 6, 1964)
                      was a Filipino revolutionary, statesman, and military
                      leader who is the youngest president of the Philippines
                      (1899-1901) and is recognized as the first president of
                      the Philippines and of an Asian constitutional republic.
                      He led Philippine forces first against Spain in the
                      Philippine Revolution (1896-1898), then in the
                      Spanish-American War (1898), and finally against the
                      United States during the Philippine-American War
                      (1899-1901).

                      Aguinaldo remains a controversial figure in Filipino
                      history. Though he has been recommended as a national hero
                      of the Philippines, many have criticized him for the
                      deaths of the revolutionary leader Andr√©s Bonifacio and
                      general Antonio Luna, as well as his collaboration with
                      the Japanese Empire during their occupation of the
                      Philippines in World War II.
